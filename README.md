# 📰 Up to Data - Your Go-To News App!

Call to all Android users and a special shoutout to my LinkedIn network! 💫

This project marks a major milestone in my Android development journey. I created **Up to Data**, a news app that allows users to seamlessly follow the latest news from various sources. Throughout the process, I applied many new concepts and technologies I learned during my training, which significantly enhanced my skills.

## 🔑 Key Technologies I Used:

- 🛠 **MVVM Architecture**: Ensured a clean and scalable codebase by separating logic from the UI.
- 🌐 **Retrofit**: Handled API integration and data updates smoothly.
- ⏳ **Kotlin Coroutines**: Managed asynchronous tasks efficiently for better data handling.
- 🗄 **Room Database**: Utilized a local database for efficient data storage and retrieval.
